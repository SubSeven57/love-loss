# How to Use #

What you have in this page are files in the .tg format.
In order to listen to them, you will need to download the free and open-source application called TuxGuitar, which you can download at [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/tuxguitar/files/TuxGuitar/TuxGuitar-1.2/)

Most of the tracks in this folder are completed or very near it. Occasionaly David and I will fix something or add something to these files. Changes to these files will be officialy stopped once they are officialy recorded and released in a record or EP. 
We would love to hear feedback and your constructive thoughts on them. This is the only way we can grow as musicians.
